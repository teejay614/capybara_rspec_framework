# capybara_rspec_framework
Building a Capybara RSpec framework based off this documentation https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara

Simple script that:
1. goes to leedcode.in/edit 
2. fills in an input field with full name
3. asserts that the field now is populated with full name

To run the script:
1. download ruby https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
2. navigate to root directory and run 'bundle install'
3. run 'rspec' in root directory
